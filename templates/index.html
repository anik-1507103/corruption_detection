        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>using machine learning technique</i></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">We have created a website that determines the corruption level of a organization.We use this website as User feedback interface to gather large amount of dataset. Then we extract feature sets and apply with different types of clustering algorithm. Then we visualize the organization into 2D plots applying PCA by reducing the attribute. Check the performance of various clustering algorithm with less error rate than others
        <br>
        In this website, we have applied different clustering technique to cluster the data of same types i.e. k-means, k-medoid, spectral. K-means algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group. It assigns data points to a cluster such that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and the clusterâ€™s centroid (arithmetic mean of all the data points that belong to that cluster) is at the minimum. In contrast to the k-means algorithm, k-medoids chooses data points as centers (medoids or exemplars) and can be used with arbitrary distances, while in k-means the centre of a cluster is not necessarily one of the input data points (it is the average between the points in the cluster).  Spectral Clustering is a growing clustering algorithm which has performed better than many traditional clustering algorithms in many cases. It treats each data point as a graph-node and thus transforms the clustering problem into a graph-partitioning problem
